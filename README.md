React Profile UI

This project is a React + Tailwind CSS application that allows users to create a profile as either a Seeker or Supporter. Supporters can further 
choose to be a Certified Professional or Peer Supporter. The app validates user input, enforces area selection rules, and stores submitted data 
in Firebase Realtime Database.
